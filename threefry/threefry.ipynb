    "## Threefish\n",
    "\n",
    "The Threefish block cipher is a part of the encryption candidate [Skein](http://www.skein-hash.info/).\n",
    "A [block cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher) is a reversible transformation of a\n",
    "sequence of bytes that depends on a user chosen key. Threefish (see the Wikipedia\n",
    "[page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threefish) and the official\n",
    "[specification](http://www.skein-hash.info/)) is built of several simple components:\n",
    "  - a mix function that operates on words\n",
    "  - a permutation function $\\pi$ that operates on several consecutive words\n",
    "  - a key schedule, that defines how the information in the key is applied within the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, a *word* is defined as a sequence of 64 bits. In practice, it is stored as an unsigned 64-bit\n",
    "integer. All sums are computed modulo $2^{64}-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full algorithm, going from a series of \"plain text\" words $p_i$ to the corresponding \"cipher\" $c_i$\n",
    "consists in applying the following steps for $N_r$ rounds:\n",
    "1. one round in four, add the key to the current value of the data\n",
    "2. apply the mix function to two consecutive words at a time\n",
    "3. permute the words according to $\\pi$\n",
    "\n",
    "After the last round, a final addition of the key is applied and the full data is XOR-ed with the\n",
    "initial value $p$. In Threefish, the key schedule is modified by a *tweak*, an extra set of two\n",
    "words.\n",
    "The specification provides:\n",
    "  - a set of rotation constants for the mix function\n",
    "  - the constant C240 that is part of the key schedule\n",
    "  - the permutation function $\\pi$\n",
    "  - the number of rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threefish is specified for blocks of 256, 512 and 1024 bits. Below is a plain implementation of\n",
    "Threefish-256 that operates on 4 words blocks, in Python (the code is intended for Python 3).\n",
    "The test reproduces the content of the example found on the official NIST CD release of Skein.\n",
    "Intermediate steps are obtained by adding the argument \"debug=True\"."

    "The use of the the Skein algorithm (based on Threefish) is already mentioned in its specification, but\n",
    "the paper by Salmon *et al* goes further by specializing the algorithm (and others as well) for use in a\n",
    "PRNG context. I present here their specialization of Threefish: Threefry.\n",
    "Threefry is based on the Threefish block cipher, with two shortcuts. The number of rounds is reduced and\n",
    "the tweak that influence the key schedule is removed. I concentrate here on Threefry-2x64, that is using\n",
    "two 64-bit words, with 20 rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas the prototypical PRNG steps from integer value to integer value using (more or less) complex\n",

    "The purpose of a cryptographic algorithm is to make it hard to guess the input from the output. Changing\n",
    "the input value from $i$ to $i+1$ will output an uncorrelated value.\n",
