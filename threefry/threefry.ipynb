    "The Threefish block cipher is a part of the encryption candidate [Skein](http://www.skein-hash.info/).\n",
    "A [block cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher) is a reversible transformation of a\n",
    "sequence of bytes that depends on a user chosen key. Threefish (see the Wikipedia\n",
    "[page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threefish) and the official\n",
    "[specification](http://www.skein-hash.info/)) is built of several simple components:\n",
    "  - a mix function that operates on words\n",
    "  - a permutation function $\\pi$ that operates on several consecutive words\n",
    "  - a key schedule, that defines how the information in the key is applied within the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, a *word* is defined as a sequence of 64 bits. In practice, it is stored as an unsigned 64-bit\n",
    "integer. All sums are computed modulo $2^{64}-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full algorithm, going from a series of \"plain text\" words $p_i$ to the corresponding \"cipher\" $c_i$\n",
    "consists in applying the following steps for $N_r$ rounds:\n",
    "1. one round in four, add the key to the current value of the data\n",
    "2. apply the mix function to two consecutive words at a time\n",
    "3. permute the words according to $\\pi$\n",
    "\n",
    "After the last round, a final addition of the key is applied and the full data is XOR-ed with the\n",
    "initial value $p$. In Threefish, the key schedule is modified by a *tweak*, an extra set of two\n",
    "words.\n",
    "The specification provides:\n",
    "  - a set of rotation constants for the mix function\n",
    "  - the constant C240 that is part of the key schedule\n",
    "  - the permutation function $\\pi$\n",
    "  - the number of rounds.\n",

    "Threefish is specified for blocks of 256, 512 and 1024 bits. Below is a plain implementation of\n",

    "The test reproduces the content of the example found on the official NIST CD release of Skein.\n",

    "content of the file `KAT_MCT/skein_golden_kat_internals.txt`.\n",
