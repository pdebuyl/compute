# Computing scripts

This repository contains computational code related to my work (statistical
physics).  There is mix of input scripts for simulation codes (lammps, for
instance), data analysis code, and whatever I need for my current research.

A clear goal is to maintain open science practice for myself but also to have a
version-controlled environment as my default work habit.
